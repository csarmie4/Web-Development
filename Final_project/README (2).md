# Fullstack Application Project

## Overview

In this project, I will build a "crowdsourced data application". I will use all of the technologies I have learned (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL) to create an API and front-end website.


## Specifications

Create a new npm project from scratch (using `npm init`) and create an express full-stack application


1. Data Storage
- Data will be stored in a MySQL database using the Sequelize library. Table(s) are be generated from a sequelize model. 

- In `documentation.md`, each field in data will be specified.

2. Adding new data
- Users will be able to add data to the database in two ways:
- Submitting an HTML form.
- Send a POST request to an API endpoint.

3. Viewing data
- The HTML pages are generated using Handlebars.

4. Search Data
- On the home page, there is a search bar that searches an appropriate field. It checks that the search query is a substring of the field it is searching.

5. Navigation Pages
- On the home page and each link, a navigation bar is provided with 5 links. These link filter the data specified in the link name.
