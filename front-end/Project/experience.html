                <li><strong>Computer Vision Intern</strong>(<i>Summer, 2021</i>)</li>
                <p>In this internship I got experience with a Jetson Nano by turning on lights inside a mosquito classification device. My assignment was gather the correct light that could fluoresce the mosquito and the correct lense that could capture that light and remove the noise. After setting the material up I used the GPIOs in the jetson nano to shine the light and capture the images to study. </p>
                <p>I got experience in python coding while learning and editing their classification code. One major role I was assigned to was to convert all image data into JSON file format that was sutible to open in another software. This was done in python and the files were transfered to labelme where the data could be easily manipulated where it could be converted again to an updated JSON file.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I was tasked with using my gained knowledge to segmentate fluoresced mosquitos in given images.</p>
                <p>My supervisors taught me how to use varies skills. For example, I got experience with new python libraries like openCV and sklearn.  I was introduced to windows subsystem for linux(wsl) where I learned more linux commands and techniques. I also learned various computer vision techniques like color masking, blob detection, K-means clustering, applying kernels to images, image filtering, image morphology, and segmentation.  </p>
