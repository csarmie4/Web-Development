                <p>Hello, I will talk about some things I enjoy to do in my spare time. I enjoy watching gymnastics and watching tv shows especially when I have extra time especially on the weekends. I sometimes read books and articles, but most of the time they are work related. For example, I read plenty of gymnastics articles to better my skills as a coach, and engineering books when I want to expand my knowledge. Some engineering books I own talk about computer vision, openCV, machine learning, and advanced python skills. Below I will list some of my favorite hobbies, shows, and foods!</p>
